        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
  
            <p>In my professional journey within equestrian-oriented roles, I've cultivated adaptability, passion, and 
                creativity. Within this realm, I discovered my aptitude for contributing to the development and launch 
                of online auction platforms, as evidenced by my successful endeavors with Equiauction and the US-branded 
                bloodstockauction.com.<br>
                After transitioning from the equestrian space, I embarked on a three-year tenure 
                as a finance broker in the dealership industry. This experience provided me with valuable insights into 
                the world of brokering and the intricacies of the financial landscape. Motivated by my unwavering hunger 
                for innovation and collaboration, I sought out an executive role that allows me to flourish by embracing 
                both of these elements. My innate drive to push boundaries and think outside the box finds a perfect match 
                in this position.
